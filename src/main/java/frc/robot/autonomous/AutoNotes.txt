Just some notes when writing auto paths:

Each grid has been given a label: 
 - Innermost grid = a
 - Central grid = b
 - Side grid = c 

Each potential starting position for the game pieces has also been given a label:
 - Closest to substation side = 1
 - 2nd from substation side = 2
 - 3rd from substation side = 3
 - Farthest from substation side = 4

 Coordinates (in meters) for each of the above-mentioned objects (according to PathPlanner):
 a - (1.88m, 4.43m)
 b - (1.88m, 2.75m)
 c - (1.88m, 1.07m)
 1 - (7.07m, 4.60m)
 2 - (7.07m, 3.39m)
 3 - (7.07m, 2.18m)
 4 - (7.07m, 0.95m)

 If these don't work, update these values to ones based on the game manual

 Other Notes:
 Robot width (with bumpers)= 0.84m
 Robot length (with bumpers)= 0.99m
